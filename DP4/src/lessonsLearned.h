/*
 -  1.	DP5
 -  2.	Consider the 4 new design patterns that fit the varies paradigm
 *  3.	Run size calc: runSize = orderSize/cavities
 *  4.	Null Observers don't respond to pause
 -  5.	Strategy needs to be more separate from Template Method
 -  6.	All design patterns should have at least 3 derived classes (CofR)
 -  7.	Present final Part 1 first day of class
 -  8.	Be able to deal with C+11 (shared_ptr, unique_ptr, etc.)
 -  9.	Dual grades:
 -  	9.1  Time: 2 hrs => A(4), 3 hrs => B(3), 4 hrs => C(2), 5 hrs => D(5).
 -  	9.2  Quality: subjective, but
 -  		 9.2.1	Perfect(4) - Dtors, white space, punc only
 -  		 9.2.2	Excellent(3) - Misspellings
 -  		 9.2.3	Good(2) - A few missing or incorrect lines
 -  		 9.2.4	Fair(1) - Major elements wrong or missing
 -  		 9.2.5	Poor(0) - Fails to run to completion
 - 10.	Output bin should have a capacity that triggers the pause when full
 - 11.	Injection run should trigger 1 to 3 full output bins
 - 12.	Dtor instrumentation should be a command line option
 - 13.	Tag blank should depend on mold shape (18 to 26 mm, say)
 - 14.	Molds should have a duration count and limit
 - 15.	Mold duration should depend on "glassiness' of plastic
 - 16.	Recipe should account for additives more realistically
 - 17.	Add inventory/Sister objects to hold existing & new molds (life & limit)
 - 18.	CofR should depend on inventory object & required run size
 - 19.	Molds with life < 10% should be chucked, rest returned to inventory
 - 20.	Add more metals (alloys)
 - 21.	Add injection facility pictures to lecture
 - 22.	Add EDM milling
 * 23.	Make sure dtor instrumentation deletes in opposite to creation order
 - 24.	Keep the final, and all the clues
 - 25.	Student's email original specs solution at start of Part 2 final
 - 26.	More framework friendly and realistic defaults
 - 27.	Use design patterns in the architecture of the class code
 - 28.	Be clearer about the final file names
 * 29.	ID the injection line machine derived type in the output
 - 30.	Be prepared to compile student's code if in folder architecture
 - 31.	Correct tag list spacing inside brackets [Country Date]
 - 32.	Make design pattern dtor number a coding option
 - 33.	Allow multiple molds of the same shape (pick one w/ enough life)
 - 34.	Each strategy pattern should be used at least once
 - 35.	One of the initially constant TM_4 steps should have to become virtual
 - 36.	Consider adding dryers, visual inspection, rejections affect run size
 * 37.	Fully decouple the decision logic
