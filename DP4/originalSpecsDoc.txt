	11.2 car (40 cc)
	11.3 hero (50 cc)
12. Molds are be pulled fron inventory or milled from bulk metal
	12.1 (To keep the final simple, the order will specify the mold location.)
		12.1.1 If location and shape unknown, default to duck from inventory

	13.3 grind
14. Support two finishes:
	14.1 smooth
	14.2 rippled
15. Support two milling platforms:

16. Support three tags, widths in mm (inserted into molds, typically under the support base, think plastic toy):
	16.1 ModelNumber (2 mm)
	16.2 Country (2 mm)
	16.3 Date (2 mm)
	16.4 Total space for tags is 20 mm
		16.4.1 cout << "    Insert tags [space separated list of tags ] of width <n>/20 mm.\n";
	16.5 Ignore unknown tags
		16.5.1 cout << "Ignoring unknown tag <tag>.\n"
17. Support two additives, the order specifies the volume in cc:
	17.1 UVInhibiter
	17.2 AntiBacterial
18. Support six colors (for simplicity, assume volume is 10% of shape, and die is independent of plastic type):
	18.0 black
	18.1 brown

	18.4 yellow
	18.5 green

20. Support three injection cycles, depends on plastic:
	20.1 ABS:  heat to 440 - inject at 125 PSI - cool to 360 - progressive eject
	20.2 Poly: heat to 350 - inject at  90 PSI - cool to 290 - smooth eject
	20.3 PET:  heat to 404 - inject at 110 PSI - cool to 340 - smooth eject
21. Support three upline machines pausing when package/output/parts bin is full:
	21.1 IJM
	21.2 Conveyer belt
	21.3 Packager
	21.4 Note: (The example output file is a little weak here, done more correctly, the diffs will be off a little.)
22. Simulate cycling the IJM for the specified plastic times
	22.1 cout << "    Cycle IJM for <plastic> <size> times.\n";
	22.2 cout << "      Close - heat to <temp> - inject at <psi> PSI - cool to <temp> - separate - <technique> eject.\n";
	22.3 cout << "      <Packager> package bin full...\n";
	22.3.1 cout << "        IJM pausing while CardboardBox package bin is swapped.\n";
	22.3.2 cout << "        Conveyer belt pausing while CardboardBox package bin is swapped.\n";
	22.3.3 cout << "        Packager pausing while CardboardBox package bin is swapped.\n";

23. Clean the molds, depends on plastic and metal:
	23.1 Use existing cleaning methods (see namespace legacy)
	23.2 cout << "    Clean <plastic> <optional metal> mold: <cleaning steps>.\n";

24. Instrument the destructors:
	24.1 cout << "~<ClassName> ";
	24.2 Use newlines to logically group the class heirarchies
	24.3 Classes may be suffixed with design pattern name/abbreviation and/or presentation order

25. To get the diffs to zero:
	25.1 In main(int argc, char* args[]):
		25.1.1 cout << "Hello DP4.\n" << endl;
		25.1.2 final_design_file::demo(string(args[1]));	// Pass in the input file (orders_1.txt).
		25.1.3 cout << "Aloha DP4.\n";
